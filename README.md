# Multifunctional BMI Scale Project

This repository was created to organize a university group project. The main objective of the project is to develop a multifunctional scale that uses Arduino and a variety of sensors to help regular users monitor their health status. The scale provides a range of outputs, including:

- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Daily Caloric Intake**
- **Daily Water Intake**
- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**

## Overview

The project uses a combination of mass sensors and ultrasonic sensors integrated with an Arduino board. A notebook (or computer) is used to input the necessary user information, such as height, weight, age, and gender. Based on the input data, the system processes the information and computes the health-related metrics, ensuring that users can easily keep track of their physical condition.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Input user details easily using a connected notebook.
- **Real-Time Measurements:** Utilizes mass and ultrasonic sensors for accurate readings.
- **Comprehensive Health Metrics:** Displays BMI, recommended daily caloric and water intake, and basal metabolic rate.
- **Cost-Effective and Innovative:** Designed to offer a practical and affordable solution for daily health monitoring.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data:** The user enters their physical data:
   - Height (in cm)
   - Mass (in kg)
   - Age
   - Sex
2. **Sensor Integration:** Mass sensors and ultrasonic sensors capture the necessary readings.
3. **Processing:** The Arduino board processes the inputs to compute the health metrics.
4. **Output:** The system displays the following outputs:
   - Calculated BMI
   - BMI Classification (e.g., Normal, Overweight, etc.)
   - Recommended daily caloric intake (kcal)
   - Recommended daily water intake (liters)
   - Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

## Project Challenges

During the development of this project, the team encountered several challenges:
- **Integration of Hardware and Software:** Ensuring seamless communication between the Arduino hardware and the software interface.
- **Accuracy:** Achieving efficiency and precision in data acquisition and processing.
- **Innovation:** Applying existing electronic knowledge and finding cost-effective solutions.
